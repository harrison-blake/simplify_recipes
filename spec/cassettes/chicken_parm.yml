And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's\nactually pretty easy to make at home.\n\nIn fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your\nown kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan\nserved in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and\ncheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it\ndoesn't have to be that way, not with this method.\n\nUnlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken\nwith sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put\nany sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the\nbreading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken\nParmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also\nuse some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of\nchicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture\nof fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.\n\nAnother little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the\nbreadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and\nParmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them\nto a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay,\nnow let's break it down.\n\nAllrecipes\n\n##  Chef John's Top Tips for Making Chicken Parmesan\n\nBefore we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked\nchicken Parmesan:\n\n  1. **Pound chicken to an even thickness:** Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.\n  2. **Don 't skimp on seasoning: **Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.\n  3. **Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs:** Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.\n  4. **Rest before cooking:** Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.\n  5. **Go easy on the sauce:** THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?\n  6. **Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot:** Be sure your oven is _completely_ preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.\n\nNow find out the best wine to pair with your non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked\nchicken Parmesan. Enjoy!\n\n##  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise\n\n\"Perfectly delicious and beautiful just as instructed!\" says angie. \"As the\nvideo explains, too much sauce and/or cheese only takes away from the flavor \u2014\nI learned this by experience. **I suggest having additional sauce and/or\ncheese available if guests choose to add more** on their plate, but personally\nthink less is more in this case.\"\n\n\"This recipe delivers!\" raves deneice knotts. \"This was SO easy. My chicken\nwas juicy and crunchy plus the cheesy goodness. YUM!! My son said this\n'slaps,' which means it's one of the best things he has ever tasted. Thanks!\n**I'll make this again without being afraid of dry chicken.** \"\n\n\"A wonder of wonders!\" raves Joe. \"Watch the vid! Chef John has some cost-\neffective tips on flouring your chicken. As well as seasoning the chicken,\ninstead of the flour, eggs, and panko. You will never do it any other way\nagain. Two things I changed was to use my wife's spaghetti sauce. Of course.\nThe other was to **use Italian seasoning instead of fresh basil** , which was\nnot at hand. We WILL be making this again and again.\"\n\nCook Mode (Keep screen awake)\n\n## Ingredients\n\n1x\n\n2x\n\n4x\n\nOops! Something went wrong.

I was also impressed. It\u2019s a small labor of love but worth it! And\nwhile it feels like a lot of steps, they are actually pretty simple. The only\nchange; I didn\u2019t have fresh basil so I added about a tsp of dried to the\npanko/parmesan mix. Wish I had fresh basil but my adaptation worked. Served\nover a simple butter noodle recipe from this site. Great! And I have already\nbeen asked to make again! Sure will! Thanks Chef John!\n\n03 of 1,643\n\nPhoto by  Lori Kempen\n\n09/11/2024\n\nA keeper! Great flavors Worth the effort Family favorite\n\nI will definitely do this again. I was rushing a bit and didn\u2019t have the\ntomato sauce on hand so substituted onions saut\u00e9ed in butter, plus two chopped\ntomatoes with salt and oregano. My whole family loved it, even the picky ones.\nIt used up a lot of dishes, so there was sincere regret on the part of the\nwasher. I live overseas in a heavily taxed country\u2014 on imports and in country\nindustry\u2014so I\u2019ll probably always make my tomato sauce\u2014I would drain it next\ntime as it was slightly mushy in places under the cheese. I\u2019ll try to figure\nout how to have less dishes next time. I left it in a little longer than\nnecessary, but it was delicious, even though it didn\u2019t look nearly as nice as\nChef John\u2019s. Not a scrap was left.Update: I tried it again and cooked the\ntomato sauce in the pan, wiped it out and filled it with oil. I laid the fried\nchicken on paper towels so that when I baked it, the lack of grease made it\nway easier to clean. I rinsed the dipping bowls (eggs, flour, etc) right away.\nMy family all loved it, and cleanup was a breeze.\n\n04 of 1,643\n\nPhoto by  Allrecipes Member\n\n09/09/2024\n\nOnly made 2 and the cast-iron skillet worked beautifully.

Worth the effort Easy to follow Great flavors\n\nMy wife and I enjoyed the recipe very much although next time; I'll remember\nto flour the breasts between the salt n pepper and beaten egg . Even without\nthe flour, the breading stayed on however, it would have been crunchier...\nstill very tasty though.The Ingredients called for 2 teaspoons of olive oil\nfor the initial frying however, the Directions said; Heat 1/2 inch olive oil\nin a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer.The Panko,\nParmesian Cheese and breasts really do need the 1/2\" of Olive Oil; I used Mild\nbecause it's for Roasting and Saut\u00e9ing (Higher heat than Extra Virgin so no\nsmoking at the needed temp...375F worked good for me; just keep it below 400F\ndue to possibly of fire.) \"Safety First\"Didn't have shredded provolone so I\nused 4 non-smoked, part skim milk sandwich slices and sliced them into 3/16\" x\n1/4\" pieces. No fresh basil on hand so a lite coating of McCormick Crushed\nBasil Leaves for my Beloved and a heavier full one-sided coating for myself;\nit tasted very mild to me sooo...next time a heavier coating...maybe some\nPerfect Pinch Italian Seasoning instead?Because I used 2 un-halved boneless\nbreasts; each was given 3 Tablespoons of crushed tomato w puree sauce and\nspread it over the surface completely....Finished product still very\ncrunchy!We like it cheesy so, additional small cubes of mozzarella were\nplanted around the outer edge of the breasts then the inside area filled in.\nThe listed 1/4c of Parmesian (I had Parm/Ramano) sprinkled both breasts\n\"completely\".At 15min of 425 deg F oven time; the breasts were at 155 deg F\nand an extra 2min put them at 170...no worries about drying out due to the\ncrust encasing.I made some spaghetti noodles w olive oil in the water to\nprevent sticking and then coated them w I Can't Believe It's Not Butter\nand...some additional Parm/Ramono...The meal was YUMMY... LOLNext time I'll\nadd some spaghetti sauce to the noodles and under the broiler; toast some\nsliced Italian sandwich bread for Garlic Bread...just for a bit more YUM.* The\ntoothpicks mark the one w the heavier seasoning so we don't get em mixed up.\n\n09 of 1,643\n\nPhoto by  Sherry\n\n05/29/2024\n\nA keeper!
